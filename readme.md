# A+E Wedding Site

* [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman), because it's great and does everything that I need.
* [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon), because it's the best mixin library I use on a regular basis.
* [Bootstrap 4](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/tree/v4-dev), because alpha builds are always smart to use on production sites.
* [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery), but only because it's an old friend I can't seem to get rid of.
* [Google Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/) + [Autotrack](https://github.com/googleanalytics/autotrack) since data is fun and I always like to know who is clicking what.
* Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) because they've got a nice and easy to use product.
