                <p class="card-text">After a fair amount of searching for the right place to get married, the Crocker Art Museum seemed like the absolute best choice for us. If you happen to be so inclined to visit the museum during your trip to Sacramento, we'd advise coming a couple hours early to enjoy the museum in all it's grandeur.</p>

            <p class="card-text">We politely ask that our guests wear clothes to our wedding. Cocktail attire is encouraged, even recommended. Required is a strong word, but how would you feel being the only person at the wedding wearing a knit romper? You'd
                look silly. Nobody wants you to look silly.</p>

We've taken it upon ourselves to make a fun little map in Google Maps with some of our favorite places to eat or do things as well as other useful wedding related stuff. And don't forget that San Francisco is all of a 90 minute drive if you wanted to make that part of your weekend.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The weather in Sacramento on the first of October is generally rather pleasant. Look for it to be in the seventies or low eighties in the early evening around the time of the ceremony. It'll cool off to the mid-sixties as the evening continues. The Crocker is right next to the Sacramento River, so that should do something to keep things from getting too roasty toasty.</p>

You can probably get around in the Sacramento area for a day or two without your own car by using Uber to get you from place to place.

Shout out to Southwest for \"shipping\" two boxes per flight, in the months leading up." }) %>

It is centrally located within walking distance of a variety of places to eat and drink, though we recommend taking a car to get to The Crocker as it may be a bit too far to comfortably walk.  Our block is available on a first come first serve basis, so please keep that in mind when trying to book a room.</p>

Being that we're two relatively well established adults who combined two homes into one over the last few years, we had a fair amount of stuff already.
