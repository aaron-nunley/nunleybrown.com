                <p class="card-text">After a fair amount of searching for the right place to get married, the Crocker Art Museum seemed like the absolute best choice for us. If you happen to be so inclined to visit the museum during your trip to Sacramento, we'd advise coming a couple hours early to enjoy the museum in all its grandeur.</p>

We've taken it upon ourselves to make a fun little city guide in Google Maps with some of our favorite places to eat and things to do, as well as other useful wedding-related stuff. And don't forget that San Francisco is all of a 90 minute drive, if you want to make that part of your weekend.</p>

                <p class="card-text">The weather in Sacramento on the first of October is generally rather pleasant. Look for it to be in the high seventies to low eighties in the early evening, around the time of the ceremony. It'll cool off to the mid-sixties as the evening continues. The cocktail hour and dancing will be outside in the courtyard, and the ceremony and reception will be indoors.  The Crocker is right next to the Sacramento River, so that should keep things from getting too roasty toasty.</p>

You can also get around in the city for a day or two by using Uber to get you from place to place.  In case you're part of the remaining several people on the planet who don't use Uber already, sign up with our referral code and get $10 off your first ride.</p>
